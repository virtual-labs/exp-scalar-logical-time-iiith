1. **Lamport Clocks – University of Washington**  
   *Link:* https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse452/19sp/slides/l3-lamportclocks.pdf  
   *Usefulness:* Provides a concise, lecture-style introduction to Lamport timestamps, covering the happened-before relation and how logical clocks ensure ordering of events. Good for quick conceptual understanding.

2. **Time, Clocks and the Ordering of Events in a Distributed System – Leslie Lamport**  
   *Usefulness:* The original foundational paper introducing logical clocks, the happened-before relation, and ordering of events in distributed systems. Essential for understanding the theory behind scalar logical time.

3. **Clocks and Synchronization – Loyola University Chicago**  
   *Link:* https://ds.cs.luc.edu/clocks/clocks.html  
   *Usefulness:* Offers detailed explanations of different clock synchronization techniques (logical, vector, physical clocks) with diagrams and examples. Good for understanding how logical clocks compare to other synchronization methods.

4. **Distributed Systems (3rd Edition) – M. van Steen & A.S. Tanenbaum**  
   *Usefulness:* Covers logical clocks, vector clocks, and synchronization in distributed systems with practical examples. Useful for understanding scalar logical time in the broader context of distributed system design.

5. **Distributed Computing: Principles, Algorithms, and Systems – Kshemkalyani & Singhal**  
   *Usefulness:* Provides in-depth algorithms for logical clocks, vector clocks, and distributed mutual exclusion. Useful for implementing simulations and understanding formal proofs relating to logical time.
